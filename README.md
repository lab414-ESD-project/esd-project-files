EEE414 - ELECTRICAL SERVICE DESIGN<br/>
PROJECT: MULTI-STORY BUILDING ELECTRICAL SERVICE DESIGN<br/>
COMPLETED: DEC 18, 2024<br/>

DESCRIPTION:<br/>
This repository contains the project files from our "Electrical Service Design" sessional project.<br/>
`files_from_above`: Contains all accessory files<br/>
`esd_project_414`: contains the design files<br/>
`study materials`: Contains a ton of study materials. Probably violates a bunch of laws. :)<br/>
This project is the result of the hard-work of 5 of the most talented and epic people (including myself) over the course of 14 weeks. We had a lot of fun doing it (at least I did), but hopefully never again :).<br/>
To the uninitiated, we engineers have to painstakingly design where to put the damn wall sockets so you can plug stuff anywhere. It requires countless sleepless hours of planning, designing, drawing and calculations. So if things are incomprehensible, don't worry. We will also probably forget half the things we've done here.<br/>
Anyway, I just want to say that I am intensely proud of my teammmates for being absolute work-horses, for making this project a success and being unconditionally co-operative. Hopefully our vibrant spirit is reflected in our work. If something remains a mystery, feel free to find your own answers cuz we'll probably forget that we even did all this :)...<br/>
Thanks for stopping by. Enjoy.<br/>
